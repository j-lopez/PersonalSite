            'This was the project that I worked on with a group ' +
            'of other seniors during our last year at CU. We were ' +
            'assigned to be sponsored by a local startup in Boulder' +
            ' called Arpeggio Biosciences. We created a web ' +
            'application for their clients to be able to securely ' +
            'log in, view, and explore their data.',

        'Arpeggio Biosciences applies machine learning methods to drugs sent to them ' +
        'by pharmaceutical companies who are wondering about the affects their drug ' +
        'might have. Prior to us, they would deliver the results by either attaching ' +
        'it to a Google Docs file or physically mailing them a flash drive with the ' +
        'data. We fixed this problem by building a secure login system where their ' +
        'clients could login, view, and interact with their data. Our work in creating ' +
        'this was awarded "Best Project" at CU\'s 2019 Expo, and will soon be an ' +
        'actual feature for Arpeggio\'s clients.',
        '    This application was built primarily with React for the frontend UI/UX, ' +	
        'MySQL for a relational database on the backend, and a python Flask API to ' +
        'allow the two to communicate. Early on we chose to use Docker to be able ' +
        'to keep the application working consistently on all machines. Our team ' +
        'followed the Agile methodology throughout the year with 2-week sprints. This ' +
        'proved beneficial because the needs of a startup change so frequently that	' +
        'it was necessary for us to be able to change our priorities.',
        '    In my group, I was the most inexperienced of the bunch. In school I ' +
        'would insist on completing as many of my assignments as alone as possible, ' +
        'and because of this I struggled adjusting understanding the importance of ' +
        'communication with what I was working on. My team had patience with me with ' +
        'this, and over the year I became better at being able to effectively ' +
        'communicate both the technical and non-technical sides of my tasks. Outside ' +
        'of the various technologies I got the chance to play with in building this, ' +
        'some of the most invaluable experience I gained in building this product was ' +
        'learning to understand my role as a member of a team on a large and constantly ' +
        'evolving software project.']
