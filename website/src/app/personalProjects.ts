            'This was the project that I worked on with a group ' +
            'of other seniors during our last year at CU. We were ' +
            'assigned to be sponsored by a local startup in Boulder' +
            ' called Arpeggio Biosciences. We created a web ' +
            'application for their clients to be able to securely ' +
            'log in, view, and explore their data.',

        'Arpeggio Biosciences applies machine learning methods to drugs sent to them ' +
        'by pharmaceutical companies who are wondering about the affects their drug ' +
        'might have. Prior to us, they would deliver the results by either attaching ' +
        'it to a Google Docs file or physically mailing them a flash drive with the ' +
        'data. We fixed this problem by building a secure login system where their ' +
        'clients could login, view, and interact with their data. Our work in creating ' +
        'this was awarded "Best Project" at CU\'s 2019 Expo, and will soon be an ' +
        'actual feature for Arpeggio\'s clients.',
        '    This application was built primarily with React for the frontend UI/UX, ' +	
        'MySQL for a relational database on the backend, and a python Flask API to ' +
        'allow the two to communicate. Early on we chose to use Docker to be able ' +
        'to keep the application working consistently on all machines. Our team ' +
        'followed the Agile methodology throughout the year with 2-week sprints. This ' +
        'proved beneficial because the needs of a startup change so frequently that	' +
        'it was necessary for us to be able to change our priorities.',
        '    In my group, I was the most inexperienced of the bunch. In school I ' +
        'would insist on completing as many of my assignments as alone as possible, ' +
        'and because of this I struggled adjusting understanding the importance of ' +
        'communication with what I was working on. My team had patience with me with ' +
        'this, and over the year I became better at being able to effectively ' +
        'communicate both the technical and non-technical sides of my tasks. Outside ' +
        'of the various technologies I got the chance to play with in building this, ' +
        'some of the most invaluable experience I gained in building this product was ' +
        'learning to understand my role as a member of a team on a large and constantly ' +
        'evolving software project.']

        'I picked up this project to address two issues. The first was ' +
        'I didn\'t have a place on this world wide web that I could call my own. ' +
        'Of course I wanted it to look well, so I used it as the perfect ' +
        'excuse to tackle the second issue, which was that I wanted to challenge myself to ' +
        'build in a frontend framework I have not used before, I chose Angular!',

        descriptionLong: [
        'Before this site, I didn\'t have a centralized location on the internet ' +
        'that I could truly call my own. I knew that I needed this to have a place ' +

        'where people could learn more about me (if you\'re reading this, I guess this ' +
        'is for you!) I wanted to keep my coding skills sharp over the summer while I ' +
        'look for work, so I decided to let this be the first personal passion project ' +
        'I produce.',
        '    After working with React, I became hungry to learn more about frontend ' +
        'developing, but I also wanted the challenge myself to change up my approach to ' +
        'coding. After some research and decided that I would experiment with Angular 8 ' +
        'to build this site. Angular may have been overkill for building a single-page ' +
        'website, but it wound up proving incredibly beneficial for creating a strong ' +
        'foundation I can easily build on top of, as well as a great first experience ' +
        'with the framework as I learned the basics.',
        '    I enjoy coding when I know the goal I am aiming for. This is easy ' +
        'to determine when given an assignment to complete, but much harder to define ' +
        'when doing something for yourself. I didn\'t know where to begin in setting up ' +
        'a view for the site, and rusty HTML/CSS caused a lot of frustration early on. ' +
        'After a while I decided to pull out a notebook to try sketching out how I ' +
        'would want a certain section to look, and then use that idea to create the ' +
        'view on the screen. This greatly accelerated my work pace because it gave me ' +
        'the goal I was looking for, and helped me design a page I am proud of!'
